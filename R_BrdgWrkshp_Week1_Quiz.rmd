## 1. Create a vector that contains 20 numbers: 

``` {r include= TRUE}
data.set <- c(5:13, 10:15, 3:6, 20)
data.set
length(data.set)
```


# 2. Convert the vector from  1 into a character vector:

``` {r}
character.data.set <- as.character(data.set)
is.character(character.data.set)
```


# 3. Convert the vector from  1 into a vector of factors:

``` {r}
factor.data.set <- as.factor(data.set)
is.factor(factor.data.set)
```


# 4. Show how many levels the vector in the previous:

``` {r}
factor.data.set
```


# 5. Vector that takes the vector from  1 and performs on it the formula 3x2 - 4x + 1:

``` {r}
formula.data.set <- ((3*data.set ^ 2 ) - (4*data.set) + 1)
formula.data.set
```


# 6. Create a named list. That is, create a list with several elements that are each able to be referenced by name:

``` {r}
nfl.win.count.list <- c("Patriot" = 5, "Jets" = 3, "Bills" = 4, "Dolphins" = 4)
nfl.win.count.list["Bills"]
```


# 7. Create a data frame with four columns – one each character, factor (with three levels), numeric, and date. Your data frame should have at least 10 observations (rows):

``` {r}
id.numeric.list <- c(1:10)
played.date.list <- rep( as.Date("2019-12-20") , 10)
grade.list <- c("A","B","A+", "B", "B", "A","A+","B","A","B")
grade.factor.list <-  as.factor(grade.list)
name.char.list <- c("Hockey", "Football", "Baseball", "Curling", "Rugby", "Lacrosse", "Basketball", "Tennis", "Cricket", "Soccer") 

theDF.data.set <- data.frame (id = id.numeric.list, Name = name.char.list, Grade =grade.factor.list ,PlayedOn =played.date.list, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

theDF.data.set

nrow(theDF.data.set)

```


# 8. Illustrate how to add a row with a value for the factor column that isn’t already in the list of levels. (Note: You do not need to accomplish this with a single line of code.):

``` {r}
levels(theDF.data.set$Grade) <- c(levels(theDF.data.set$Grade), "A-")

theDF.data.set[nrow(theDF.data.set)+1, ]  <- list(id=11,Name="Squash", Grade ="A-", PlayedOn= as.Date("2019-12-21"))

theDF.data.set
nrow(theDF.data.set)
```


# 9. Show the code that would read in a CSV file called temperatures.csv from the current working directory

```{r}
getwd()
temperature.data <-read.table(file="temperatures.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
temperature.data
```


# 10. Use a loop to calculate the final balance, rounded to the nearest cent, in an account that earns 3.24% interest compounded monthly after six years if the original balance is $1,500 :

``` {r}
get.final.balance <- function(amt, rate, frequency, duration)
{
   return (round( amt * (1 + ((rate / 100)/frequency) ) ^ (frequency * duration ) , digits=2))
}

get.final.balance(amt=1500, rate=3.24, frequency= 12 , duration=6)

```


# 11. Create a numeric vector of length 20 and then write code to calculate the sum of every third element of the vector you have created: 
```{r}
num_vector <- c(1:20)
i <- 1
sum_third <- 0
while(i <= length(num_vector))
{
  if ((i %% 3) == 0)
  {
    sum_third <- sum_third + num_vector[i]
  }
  i <- i + 1
}
num_vector
sum_third
```


# 12. Use a for loop to calculate ∑ 𝑥𝑥 10 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1 for the value 𝑥𝑥 = 2.

``` {r}
final.val <- 0
x <- 2
for (i in 1:10) 
  {
    final.val <- final.val  + ( x ^ i )
  }
final.val

```


# 13. Use a while loop to accomplish the same task as in the previous exercise:

``` {r}
final.while.val <- 0
x <- 2
i <- 1
while ( i <= 10 ) 
  {
    final.while.val <- final.while.val  + ( x ^ i )
    i <- i+1
  }
final.while.val

```


# 14. Solve the problem from the previous two exercises without using a loop:
```{r}
loop.num.list <- c(1:10)
x <- 2
val <- 2 ^ loop.num.list
sum(val)

```
